# Efficient-use-of-visual-transformers
This repository is for the "Efficient use of visual transformers" project.
This includes 2 jupyter notebooks to run on kaggle.
"ViT Quantization" is meant to test quantization on the ViT model from PyTorch.
"ViT Inference" is meant to test speeding inference time on the ViT model from huggingface.

# How to run
simply download the notebook and run it on kaggle.
to do so you will need to access the validation dataset we have prepared manually.
